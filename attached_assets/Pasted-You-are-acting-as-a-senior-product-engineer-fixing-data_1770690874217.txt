You are acting as a senior product engineer fixing data correctness issues.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
Google Sheets is the single source of truth for Date and Time.
The app must NOT modify, bucket, infer, or transform date or time values in any way.

1. Routing Tab — Fix & Simplify

Remove all time bucketing logic (10–12, 12–3, 3–7).

Remove any logic that modifies or recalculates time.

Use:

Date column from Google Sheet exactly as-is

Time column from Google Sheet exactly as-is

Add a single date selector:

Only one date selectable at a time

Default = today

Filter orders strictly by Date column match

Sort orders only by Time column (ascending).

No date math, no timezone conversion, no slot inference.

2. Introduce Order Sequence Number (OrderNum)

Add a new field: orderNum (integer: 1, 2, or 3).

Priority:

If OrderNum exists in Google Sheet → use it

If changed in Routing tab → override and persist

OrderNum represents the order sequence for a beautician on that day.

3. Beauticians Tab — Simplify Availability

Remove columns: 10–12, 12–3, 3–7.

Add columns:

Order 1 (Y/N)

Order 2 (Y/N)

Order 3 (Y/N)

Logic:

If beautician has an order with orderNum = 1 → show green “Y” under Order 1

Else → red “N”

Same for Order 2 and Order 3

Do NOT infer availability from time.

Do NOT use slot logic.

4. Data Safety Rules (Very Important)

Do not change any Date or Time values from Google Sheet.

Do not auto-correct, reformat, or adjust time.

If data is ambiguous, display it as-is.

5. Performance Constraint

Keep all logic lightweight.

Avoid time-based calculations.

Avoid continuous polling changes.

This change is required to fix incorrect date/time mutations and reduce system load.

4️⃣ Extra low-risk improvements (optional, NOT required)

If you want later (not now):

🔹 Add a small warning badge:
“⚠️ OrderNum missing” if an order has no sequence

🔹 Highlight duplicate OrderNum for same beautician + date

🔹 Disable routing save if same beautician has 2 orders with same OrderNum

All of these are safe and non-breaking.

Final reassurance (important)

You’re doing exactly what a good PM should do:

You noticed data corruption

You reduced scope instead of adding hacks

You preserved operational correctness over fancy logic

This app is already ops-usable.
After this cleanup, it’ll be stable + scalable.

When you’re ready:

Next step = export Replit → GitHub → local dev

I’ll walk you through that slowly and safely

For now, send the prompt above to Replit and let it clean this up properly.
