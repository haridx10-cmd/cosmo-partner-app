You are a senior full-stack engineer improving an existing salon employee operations admin panel.

The system already includes:

Your task is to expand the admin panel into an operations command center.

----------------------------------

• Default = Today
• Filter must apply to:
  - Overview tab
  - Orders tab
  - Issues tab
  - Routing tab

----------------------------------

Add new dashboard metrics:

1. Ongoing Orders Count
Logic:
status IN ("confirmed","in_progress")
AND appointment_date = selected date

2. Issues Count
Click → Navigate Issues tab

3. Delayed Orders Count
Logic:
current_time > appointment_time + 15 minutes
AND status != completed

Click → Navigate Orders tab with filter

4. Completed Order Value
Display:
• Count of completed orders

5. Available Beauticians
Click → Navigate Beauticians tab

----------------------------------

CREATE NEW TAB → BEAUTICIANS

• Current GPS location
• Slot Availability
   Slot 1 = 10AM–12PM
   Slot 2 = 12PM–3PM

If no order → mark "Y"
If beautician opted out → mark "WND"

• Next Slot Area
Fetch from next assigned order area

• Last Slot Indicator

----------------------------------

CREATE NEW TAB → ROUTING

Filter:

----------------------------------

TEAM TAB UPDATE

Add click-to-call functionality for employees.

----------------------------------

DATABASE CHANGES

Extend Orders table with:

beauticianHomeArea
orderAreaName
acceptanceStatus

----------------------------------

PERFORMANCE RULES

Avoid heavy map distance calculations.
Reuse tracking data instead of recalculating location repeatedly.
Use indexed queries on appointment_date and beauticianName.

----------------------------------

UI REQUIREMENTS

Use clean responsive tables.
Avoid heavy real-time subscriptions except tracking tab.
Ensure routing updates immediately reflect in employee panel.
